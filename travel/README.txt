Spring Travel Reference Application
- demonstrates Spring Framework 3 with Web Flow 2.1

NOTE: This sample is currently under construction.  It is in the process of being upgraded to Web Flow 2.1, which is near release.
This notice will be removed once the sample has stabilized.  At this time, review the code knowing it may not all be functional.

Known issues:
- Spring Web Flow 2.1 nightly snapshots are not yet available
- Using an extension for resource handling until mvc:resources support is integrated into Spring Framework 3.1 trunk.  This built-in resource handling support in Spring Framework will supercede the ResourceServlet in the Spring JavaScript module (see SPR-7116).
- JSR303 support is not yet integrated.
